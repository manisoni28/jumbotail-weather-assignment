# Preparing the Project
Let's put some bullets on what good architectures should be:

1. Independent
2. Testable
3. Re-usable
4. Extendable

# Building with Gradle
Itâ€™s also a good idea to put all links to maven and all global dependencies into buildscript right, i have added fab-reveal menu, william chart library ,cardview.

# Web services
I have created GenericRequestTask for genericness for the code which is extending AsyncTask and load the data in the background

# Challenges

1. Fetching data and maintaining proper Api structure
2. Thinking of proper architecture and flow
3. How to make UI and UX interactive
4. Deep linking feature,although finally code was easy but new feature to play for me
5. Changes made in location correspondingly showing changes in the chart
